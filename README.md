# LCARS
Playing around with the template from https://www.thelcars.com/, adding APIs, CSS rulesets, tweaking the colors so they have meaning.

**See it in action here:** https://matthiasjrichter.github.io/lcars/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NASA API, WTTR API


## Optimizations

1. Possibly upgrade to the newest version of the template.
2. Declutter everything. Currently there are still some elements that don't do anything.
3. Make the ultrawide sidebar visible on widescreen displays.


## Lessons Learned:

1. Sometimes APIs just don't work and it's not on my end.
2. LCARS is super fun!
